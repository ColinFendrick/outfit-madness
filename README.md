# Getting started

## Front-End

Download and cd into `frontend/`. Run `npm i`, then `npm run start`.

## Back-End

In another terminal, cd into `backend/`. Run `npm i` then `npm run start`. Keep both of these running,
and visit `localhost:3000`. Register and log in and get to work.

### To Run a Local DB

If you wish to work on a local database, run a local MongoDB, then in the backend run `npm run dev`.
__Note:__ If you have your local mongodb set to somewhere other than the defaults, update the data in
`backend/config/dev.env`.
